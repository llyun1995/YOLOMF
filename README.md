We propose YOLOMF, which employs MobileNetv3-FusedIR as the backbone network. By incorporating Fused-MBConv module into the shallow layers of MobileNetv3, we effectively alleviate the spatial feature loss caused by the inadequacy of depthwise separable convolution, thereby improving the multi-damage identification accuracy of the model. Experimental results demonstrate that YOLOMF has parameters of 11.43MB and FLOPs of 16.98GB, which are respectively 81.97% and 86.80% less than YOLOv4. Through the efficient collaboration of MobileNetv3-FusedIR with Hard-Swish and SiLU activation functions, YOLOMF achieves mAP of 77.32% and F1 score of 71.95%, which are 6.56% and 8.59% higher than the original YOLOv4, respectively. Moreover, YOLOMF's multi-damage recognition performance surpasses that of advanced object detection models such as YOLOv8-s.
